                <h4><b><u>STAGES OF SLEEP</b></u></h4>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <p>Our sleep is usually split into 2 stages: non-REM sleep, which is split into 3 stages, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. During your sleep, these 4 parts will cycle every 90 minutes so you will experience around 4-6 sleep cycles in a 7-9 hour sleep.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <p class="stage">Stage 1 non-REM sleep marks the transition from wakefulness to sleep. During this stage, your muscles relax, your body temperature drops, your heartbeat and breathing slows, and sleep begins.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="a row">
              <p class="stage">Stage 2 non-REM sleep is light sleep. Your body continues to relax your muscles, drop the body temperature, and slow your heartbeat and breathing. Repair hormones, such as growth hormone, are released, tissue growth and cell repair occur, and your brain flushes out waste. When your sleep cycle repeats, you spend most of your time in this stage.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <p class="stage">Stage 3 non-REM sleep is deep sleep. Your brain waves are the slowest during this stage. Your muscles are relaxed and it is difficult to wake you. Your heartbeat and breathing are at its slowest state. This stage occurs for longer periods of time at the beginning of your sleep.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <p class="stage">REM sleep occurs about 90 minutes after you first fall asleep. Your eyes move rapidly behind your eyelids and your brain wave activity increases close to that of your brain wave activity when you are awake. Your breathing becomes faster and your heart rate and blood pressure increase. Most of your dreams occur during REM sleep. REM sleep is believed to be important for learning and memory.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <p>Because your sleep cycles repeat, you go through each of these stages multiple times during the night. However, during the beginning of the sleep, you experience a longer period of time in deep sleep, but at the end of the sleep, you experience a longer period of REM.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <p>When you are sleep deprived, you cut off the longer periods of REM sleep you normally experience later in the night. Studies have shown that REM sleep plays a role in learning and memory, so when you cut your sleep short, it becomes harder to retain information. That’s why cramming information the day before a test instead of sleeping is not effective. When sleep-deprivation is prolonged, your body will start to force REM sleep. When this occurs, you experience deeper sleep than normal because your body begins to skip over non-REM stage 2 light sleep which is important for the mental and physical restoration of your body.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <p>As you can see, sleep is very important for learning, memory, high energy, and maintaining a good mood, so make sure you get a full night’s sleep!</p>
